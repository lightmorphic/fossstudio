# Changelog

All notable changes to FOSSStudio are documented here.

## Unreleased

- Noise reduction is now controlled **per guest from the host panel**
  (small NR button beside Mute/Spotlight, state visible at a glance);
  the guest-facing option is gone and it defaults to on
- **Live sound meters** for every participant in the host panel, so the
  host can see who's making noise

- The host panel is a fixed sidebar, always open for the host — the
  video grid sizes itself around it; a **dim** button fades all controls
  (and brightens them on hover) instead of open/close
- Guests can pick their **own banner colour** from the palette when the
  host enables it — a palette button appears in everyone's controls

- Host panel: your own volume slider, per-guest **Mute/Unmute**, and a
  **Mute everyone** button; muted guests show a 🔇 on their tile, and
  mute state is shared so everyone's view agrees. Guests can still
  unmute themselves.
- Lower-third text doubled in size; accent stripe removed
- Lower-third banners overlay the bottom-left of each video, about a
  quarter of the tile wide and scaling with tile size (small tiles get
  small banners); the host picks the colour from nine swatches or a hex
  code, can give **everyone a different colour**, or let guests pick
  their own from the palette
- Host panel restyled to the Lightmorphic house look, with a close
  button; session controls swapped emoji for modern line icons
- Host panel simplified: every row (including your own) has Spotlight
  and Mute buttons — the separate layout buttons are gone; toggling the
  active Spotlight returns to the grid

- **Fix**: joining with noise suppression crashed some Chromium-based
  browsers (seen in Brave Origin) — session audio is now routed to the
  chosen speaker via an audio element instead of the AudioContext call
  that triggered the crash
- Crash safety: if a join attempt never finishes (e.g. the tab crashed
  while noise suppression was starting), the next visit turns noise
  suppression off automatically and says so
- Banner fields renamed on the join screen: **Banner title** (now
  required to join) and **Banner subtitle** (optional), no placeholder
  clutter; title and subtitle sit side by side on desktop
- Tooltips follow the house style everywhere: lozenge-shaped, matching
  the background with an outlined edge — replacing browser-native ones

## 1.1.0 — 2026-08-06

- **Lower thirds**: the small name pill became a full-width two-line
  banner on every tile — name plus an optional smaller line for a
  website, job or company, entered on the preview screen and remembered
  for next time
- **Bigger camera check**: the join card is wider on desktop with the
  preview video full-width and settings in two columns
- **Licence**: released under the GNU GPL v3
- **Fix**: deploys now always recreate containers whose files changed
  (a symlinked bind mount could previously leave stale files serving)
- **Fix**: long camera/microphone names no longer overflow the join card
- Website: full redesign with real product screenshots, per-feature
  accent colours, uniform spacing, and a Lightmorphic sponsorship

## 1.0.0 — 2026-08-06
